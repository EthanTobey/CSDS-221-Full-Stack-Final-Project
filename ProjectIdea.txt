CSDS 221 Full Stack Web Development Final Project Idea:

Flashcards/Quiz App:
 - Base Features: - Make sets of Q/A flashcards, save sets to database
             - Pull sets from database
             - Display flashcards - perhaps ask question and prompt user for answer
             - (maybe) Track user's score (how many correct of set of cards)


 - Extra Features:
     - Make private profiles s.t each user has their own private sets of flashcards only visible when they are logged in
     - Allow users to make public sets that any user can see
